# 2-1 Information Security Management

[toc]

## I. Managing Information Based on Information Security Policies

In order to take information security measures, it is necessary to clarify what and how to protect them. To this end, a unified information security policy is formulated and clearly defined as an enterprise or organization, and management is carried out based on it.

The Information Security Policy is a compilation of organizational and action policies to maintain the CID Triad of information, and it is necessary to first clarify what information (or information assets) should be protected.

### 1. Identification of information assets

Information is the knowledge acquired to know the situation, and information assets have its value. To identify information assets held by companies and organizations and clarify what should be protected.

- Physical assets: Communications equipment, computers, hard disks, etc.
- Software assets: business and system software, development tools, etc.
- Human assets: experience, functionality, qualifications, etc.
- Intangible assets: organizational image, reputation, etc.
- Service Assets: General utilities (power and air conditioning, lighting), communications services, computational services, etc).
- Direct information assets: databases, files, documentation, etc.

### 2. Information Security Incidents and Information Security Events

<u>An information security incident</u> is an incident or accident that threatens information security. In information security management, it is important to clarify the reporting and management system in the event of an information security incident, and to make it known and thorough to all concerned.

<u>Information security events</u> are situations that may affect information security in addition to information security incidents. If an information security event occurs, it is necessary to report it to the appropriate administrator.

### 3. Monitoring and reviewing information security management

Even if information security management is implemented, it may not be realized as it is or there may be deficiencies, so it is important to monitor it on a daily basis. 

In addition, information security management needs to be reviewed in response to changes in the environment. To this end, the effectiveness and continuity of the management measures are measured, and monitoring, auditing, and review are carried out.

## II. Information Security Regulations

### 1. Organization operations in line with information security policies

In order to operate an organization in accordance with the information security policy, it is necessary to prepare a written document and unify the will accordingly.

### 2. Basic Information Security Policy Configuration

#### 1) Information Security Policy

Description of information security objectives, scope, management structure, penalties, etc. correctly communicate within the organization and require stakeholders to obtain as needed

#### 2) Information Security Measures Standards

Standards for information security measures shall be based on information security policies and risk assessment results, and specific compliance measures shall be established to maintain and secure appropriate information security levels. 

#### 3) Regulations

The regulations describe specific procedures for implementing the rules set out in the information security measures standards. Typical regulations include:

- Information management regulations
- Confidential management regulations
- Document management regulations
- Malware Infection Response Rules
- Accident response regulations
- Rules for Information Security Education
- Employment contract
- Job regulations
- Rules of Penal Provisions
- Regulations for External Explanation
- Exception rule
- Rules for Renewal of Rules
- Procedures for Approval of Rules

#### 4) Personal Information and Privacy Policy

<u>Personal information</u> is information that can identify individuals, such as their name, address, and email address.

<u>Privacy policy</u> is a norm that determines how to handle collected personal information. Described as a separate policy or as part of a security policy.

## III. Information Security Management System

### 1. Scope of application

Define the scope of application of ISMS, that is, what important information needs to be protected to continue the business is to think about and determine the scope of what needs to be protected. Consider from various perspectives such as business, organization, physics, and network. It is especially important to identify boundaries.

### 2. Leadership

Top management leadership is essential in ISMS. Top management refers to the leadership that directs and manages companies.

Leadership has job-oriented leadership and relationship leadership, and it is required to change its style according to the stage of organizational development.

Since information security measures should be systematically implemented throughout the company as part of management, it is necessary to take leadership and implement them not by the Information Systems Department but by top management companies. The top management allocates responsibility and authority for roles related to information security and conducts and supports them.

### 3. Governance

Governance is to have the rules set by the organization implemented as a whole.

In ISMS, it is important to realize information security governance, and it is necessary to carry out the governance process. ISO/IEC 27014 is a governance standard.

### 4. Planning

When establishing an ISMS plan, it is necessary to determine the risks to be addressed. To this end, the information security assessment process is established and operated.

In addition, appropriate information security risk response is selected in consideration of the results. Further, the purpose of information security is clarified and documented.

### 5. Operation

In order to secure information security, appropriate operation is essential to implement and manage what is planned. In the event of regular or significant changes, it is necessary to implement information security risk management and risk response once again to prepare for new risks.

### 6. Performance Assessment

Conduct an internal audit at the ISMS implementation stage to evaluate the effectiveness of whether it is properly maintained. Top management needs to conduct management reviews to periodically check whether ISMS is valid and appropriate.

### 7. Improvement

If nonconformities occur rather than performance evaluations, improvements should be made. It is necessary to continuously improve by taking corrective action against nonconformities and reviewing their effectiveness.

### 8. ISO/IEC 27000 Family Standards

## IV. Continuing Information Security

### 1. Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

BCP is a basic plan for a company to form a business.In the event of a disaster or accident, the plan is established in advance to restore data before the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and to resume within the Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

![rpo-rto](.\imgs\rpo-rto.png)

More comprehensive management is called Business Continuity Management (BCM). BCM conducts risk analysis in advance to determine countermeasures.

### 2. Classification of Emergency Situations

In order to respond appropriately in an emergency, it is necessary to clarify the category of emergency according to the degree of emergency.

For example, threats can be classified into Level 1 (nearly no influence), Level 2 (low influence event), and Level 3 (high influence), and response can be accelerated.

### 3. Contingency Plan

Contingency plan is a plan to restore the system quickly and efficiently in the event of service interruption or disaster.

In the initial response plan, Contingency plan focuses on what to do in the initial action, and may not be fully restored, but may be provisionally responded.

It is also necessary to establish a method of investigating the damage situation and quickly collect information and respond.

### 4. Restoration Plan

restoration  plan is a plan to completely restore the business after an emergency response, and aims to restore it permanently rather than temporarily.

In particular, since recovery from natural disasters is difficult to completely recover immediately, it will be restored to a normal state one after another after taking provisional measures.

### 5. Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery is performed in case of emergency or daily failure of the system. It is important to take measures to back up data and prepare for recovery. In particular, it is also important to prepare for large-scale disasters, such as storing backup data remotely.
